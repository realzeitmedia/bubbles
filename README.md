ElasticSearch Bulk indexer

This small Go library does ElasticSearch Bulk operations only. Actions which resulted in an error will be retried individually. See example_test.go how to use this.

It is tested and used in production on the 5.X ElasticSearch series.

# Status

Used in production with millions of documents every day.

# Test

Run `make test` for the basics, no ElasticSearch daemon required.

Run `make livetest` if there is an ElasticSearch available on localhost:9200.
It'll delete the index 'bubbles'.
